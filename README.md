# Disaster Response Pipeline Project

### Summary
The following repository is made to create a pipeline for a twit analyzer, which will able a website to detect wheter a twit is a request for help, in this way, authorities will be able to go to a disaster site offering help to whoever is needing it.

The project creates a process of Extract, Transform and Load and saves it in a database accesible with SQL queries, then it creates a pipeline which solves the multiclass problem of defining which kind of help and which kind of disaster is the twit about.

The last part is a website with a visualization of the train dataset and the implementation of the model where you could write your own twit and use the model to test which category is read in it

### Packages

### Instructions:
1. Run the following commands in the project's root directory to set up your database and model.

    - To run ETL pipeline that cleans data and stores in database
        `python data/process_data.py data/disaster_messages.csv data/disaster_categories.csv data/DisasterResponse.db`
    - To run ML pipeline that trains classifier and saves
        `python models/train_classifier.py data/DisasterResponse.db models/classifier.pkl`

2. Run the following command in the app's directory to run your web app.
    `python app/run.py`
